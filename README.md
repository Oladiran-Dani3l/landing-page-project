## Feature lists and implementation details

1. ## Feature/header 
- After creating the initial HTML structure I begane the header structure. I ensured the nav links were direct children of the nav tag and not embedded in unnecessary parent tags. The hero section was a direct parent child of the header tag and there is only one instance of <h1> used in the entire code. 
- After already committing and pushing the header and main-about section branches, I edited alt attributes on images in the header section, this caused me to have to commit the same edit in the remaining branches to avoid merging conflicts. 

2. ## Feature/Main-about-section
- In this feature, the I created the main tag and the about/services section. Ensuring proper heirarchy was used in the strutcure.
- After already committing and pushing this branch, I switched to the feature/header branch and edit an alt attribute for better accessibility, causing the pushed code in the header branch and main-about section to be different. To avoid merge conflicts, I edited he same accessibility change in the feature/main-section.

3. ## Feature/Testimonial
- In this feature, the testimonial section structure was created. I ensure proper hierarchy within tags.
- Initial landing-page design did not consist of testimonial section, so I made use of a second landing page design and incorporated its testimonial section. 2nd landing page design can be found in the image file (2nd-landing-page.webp).

3. ## Feature/Our-team
- In this feature, Our team structure was created. I ensure proper hierarchy structure and made use of proper HTML 5 semantics.
- Initial landing-page design did not consist of team section, so I made use of a second landing page design and incorporated its testimonial section. 2nd landing page design can be found in the image file (2nd-landing-page.webp).

3. ## Feature/Footer
- Bottom section of project structure was created. I ensure proper hierarchy structure and made use of proper HTML 5 semantics.
- Initial landing-page design had footer section, project's footer structure was modeled after initial landing page design.



## Lessons learned from Collaboration
- Better understanding of working with Git from the terminal
- Improved ettiquettes concerning pull requests 
- Learnt to properly review code before pushing so as to avoid problems causing merge conflicts
